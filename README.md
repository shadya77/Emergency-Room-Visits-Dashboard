# Emergency-Room-Visits-Dashboard
Employed real world fake data from https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data to develop a dashboard presenting emergency room visits. The dashboard featured diverse visualizations illustrating the count of patient visits to the ER, the number of patients categorized by race and age, as well as the number of patients referred to each department. Additionally, it included average patient satisfaction and average patient wait time.
